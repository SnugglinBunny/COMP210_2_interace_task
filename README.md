# COMP210_2_interace_task

For my vr experience game I have decided I would like to build the game that I had in mind when doing my world pitch. This was a wild west shooter game based in the wake of the great frontier. I would like to use the VR Headset to help the user see and look around. On top of this I would like to take the Vive sensors and attach one to a western styled gun, like a revolver, and use this to let the player aim and shoot. The main feature I have in mind is when the player turns the gun on its side sharply it would reload similar to in westerns where they flick the gun to the side to get all the ammo out and reload.
