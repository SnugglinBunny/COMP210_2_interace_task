# COMP210_2_interace_task

## Proposal

For my shared game with the BA's we toyed with the idea of having a pet crow or a cat. With this in mind I would like to attempt to implment either one of these as a VR experiences, with a stretch goal of being able to have one person playing the game and another playing the pet in VR and being able to interact and see eachother in the same game. I think using the bird to fly around above the map would be very interesting and opens up the player to find various secret areas. I would also like to be able to pick up certain things as the bird offering another form of help to the main player.

## Market Research

For my market research I have attempted to look into games that allow one person to play one the computer with another player in virtual reality providing help to the main player. I have been unable to find games following this idea, which means I definitley won't find any which do it in the way I want to, and therefore I think it would be an interesting concept for people to play around with and hopefully find some entertainment in. Some of the most popular games available are hugely impacted by having multiplayer aspects and so I think this could be quite successful if done right.

## Design

I will be using my main BA game with the current player layout with a slight change, I will make it so that if you select to play with two players it will check that a vr headset is available. After this check the second player will be able to play alongside them in virtual reality, flying around and moving objects like a bird, clearly I will have to place limits on what the bird can pickup for immersions sake at least. This idea came out of player testing our main game people wanted stuff to be more clear but we thought it would make the game to easy so we compromised.

## Instructions

The game can be played alone as just the standard platform puzzle game, but connect a VR Headset and a second player will be able to fly above and attempt to find secrets for the player.  The headset takes the average position of both controllers and propels you in the opposite direction. For example, if you hold both you hands behind you then you will go forwards similar to how you would imagine a bird controls itself. If you want to stop still you have to hold your hands out by your sides, slightly forwards seems to work best.

## User Stories

As a user I want to be able to fly around the world without feeling sick
As a user I want to feel immersed within the games world and in the role of a bird
As a user in a two player game I want to be able to interact with eachother one some level
