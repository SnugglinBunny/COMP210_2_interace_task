# COMP210_2_interace_task

For my vr experience game I have decided I would like to build the game that I had in mind when doing my world pitch. This was a wild west shooter game based in the wake of the great frontier. I would like to use the VR Headset to help the user see and look around. On top of this I would like to take the Vive sensors and attach one to a western styled gun, like a revolver, and use this to let the player aim and shoot. The main feature I have in mind is when the player turns the gun on its side sharply it would reload similar to in westerns where they flick the gun to the side to get all the ammo out and reload.

For my shared game with the BA's we toyed with the idea of having a pet crow or a cat. With this in mind I would like to attempt to implment either one of these as a VR experiences, with a stretch goal of being able to have one person playing the game and another playing the pet in VR and being able to interact and see eachother in the same game. I think using the bird to fly around above the map would be very interesting and opens up the player to find various secret areas. I would also like to be able to pick up certain things as the bird offering another form of help to the main player.
